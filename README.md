## üìÇ Assignments

### üîπ Assignment 1: Edge Detection
**Objective:**  
The objective of this assignment is to perform edge detection on an image by applying different masks:  
- Gaussian Filter and differentiation  
- Prewitt  
- Robert  
- Sobel  
- First derivative of the Gaussian mask (Canny)  

Different thresholds are tested for detection. The MATLAB codes and results are included in the report.

**Table of Contents (summary):**
1. Objective  
2. Gaussian Filter and differentiation (with code + results)  
3. Prewitt (with code + results)  
4. Robert (with code + results)  
5. Sobel (with code + results)  
6. First derivative of the Gaussian mask (Canny) (with code + results)  
7. Conclusion

### üîπ Assignment 2: Harris Corner Detector
**Objective:**  
The objective of this assignment is to apply the **Harris Corner Detector** to two versions of an image in order to:  
1. Identify the corners in each version.  
2. Perform **corner matching** between the two images, finding corresponding corners that represent the same physical point in the scene.  

The report includes MATLAB code, visualizations, and final results.

**Table of Contents (summary):**
1. Objective  
2. MATLAB Code  
3. Image 1 (Ix, Iy, corner detection, non-maximum suppression, results)  
4. Image 2 (Ix, Iy, corner detection, non-maximum suppression, results)  
5. Corners matching  
6. Conclusion
